                        A scholarship can be defined as financial aid provided
                        to a student on the basis of his or her academic,
                        artistic, and athletic or other abilities and merit. It
                        can serve as assistance in further education of a
                        student. Generally, scholarships are granted to students
                        who apply for them, meeting certain qualifying criteria.
                        As with the grants, scholarships also do not have to be
                        repaid. In other words, it’s the financial support that
                        does not have to be repaid. There are many sources /
                        organizations like colleges, universities, academies,
                        schools, various community groups, agencies, unions,
                        religious & charitable organizations and trusts that
                        grant scholarships.

                      <p style="text-align: justify">
                        Scholarships are forms of financial aid that do not have
                        to be repaid. Normally, academic merit and meritorious
                        achievements in variety of other fields forms the basis
                        of the award of scholarships, though at times financial
                        condition and need of a scholar is considered as well.

                      <p style="text-align: justify">
                        So, summing up, we can say that scholarships are
                        monetary awards that do not have to be paid back and are
                        based on outstanding academic achievement or, in some
                        cases, demonstrated talent in varied areas and fields
                        such as sports, music, drama, etc.

                        <p style="text-align: justify">
                          In fact, scholarships are available in abundance as
                          there are millions out there but a more worrisome fact
                          is that many of them are left un availed i.e. go
                          unused on an annual basis.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify">
                          The best way to begin seeking scholarships is to
                          create a self awareness and do your research. Every
                          college and university has a bounty of scholarships to
                          be given to the meritorious students. Usually they
                          will be listed on the school's or college’s website.

                          scholarships are awarded on merit basis. Overall
                          excellent academic achievements form the eligibility

                          getting their academic degrees. Organizations or
                          committees granting such scholarships take various
                          factors into consideration such as family’s income,
                          number of members in the family and number of siblings

                          Students who have been great athletes in their

                          scholarships, the star athletes are allured by
                          different universities to recruit them for their own
                          athletic teams.

                          books and tuition fees. However, many scholarships are

                          or to be a sub-specialist in his or her field. A

                        <p style="text-align: justify">
                          Many colleges offer scholarships to students in a
                          particular subject. For a student to become eligible
                          for such type of scholarship, he or she must pursue
                          the specified subject in which he or she has
                          academically excelled as his major subject of study..
                          These types of scholarships are granted on the same
                          lines as institutional-based scholarships.

                        <p style="text-align: justify">
                          Some minority communities, ethnic groups and religious
                          organizations also provide financial aid to their
                          members to help them pursue their desired education.
                          The primary determinant for award of such a
                          scholarship is the race or religion of a student,
                          though the academic grades also are taken into
                          account.

                        <h6>Advantages of Scholarships:</h6>
                        <p style="text-align: justify">
                          Some of the most valuable advantages of getting the
                          scholarship are as follows:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>
                            Getting a scholarship is to have free money from the
                            donor to pursue further education or to meet other
                            financial needs. One of the major benefits of
                            scholarships is considerable reduction in the cost
                            of attaining the qualification. In other words, it
                            is one of the most cost-effective tools to attain
                            education. In the last few years there has been a
                            blindfold increase in the cost of education which
                            has virtually made higher education next to
                            impossible for the students from low-income group
                            families. Now, in these tough times, if such a
                            student gains scholarship then he or she gets an
                            opportunity to earn a good degree and get better
                            paying jobs which in turn can help him or her to
                            support his family.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Students can completely concentrate on their studies
                            without having any type of financial burden on them
                            like paying the fees, expenses on books and other
                            study material, etc. They can completely focus on
                            their studies without any kind of pressure.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            The tag of ‘high prestige’ is directly linked to an
                            award of scholarship, as scholarships are awarded to
                            students who hold a proven track record of a
                            brilliant score and excellence in their respective
                            fields. Thus, those who attain scholarships are
                            considered to be more intelligent people than the
                            rest and are more respected by the society.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Another good advantage is that when applying for a
                            job, scholarships serve as a highlight on a person’s
                            job resume as these are also brilliant resume
                            boosters and look fantastic when listed on the
                            resume.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Scholarships are far better than loans. Actually the
                            comparison between the two is pointless, as loans
                            come with a pay-back liability. Many students who
                            take educational loans from banks and other
                            financial institutions to earn their degrees feel it
                            really difficult to repay the loans and they are
                            continuously under pressure from the banks and other
                            financial institutions. Consequently many students
                            can be found working after college to get some money
                            for repaying their loan. Such students are stressed
                            with studies and work at the same time. The
                            enjoyment and freedom to live a stress-free life
                            becomes a distant dream for them. In such cases, the
                            scholarships can make them absolutely free from the
                            burden of repayment. Also, an additional benefit can
                            be that if they work, their earnings can be saved
                            for future benefits.
